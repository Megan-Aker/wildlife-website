# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview
This project is a fake nature site about bears. It has been marked up to acomidates for accessibility issues and aims to make the site more "accessible" to different users. 

## Accessibility Lab Answers
1. The contrast ratio is 2.79:1 for the text color and background. The ideal ratio is around 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger headings. Changing the text to be lighter on a dark background and vise versa makes for good contrast.
2. To make the html more semantically correct, it should be wrapped in a <nav> element for better accessibility. The, font tag for the heading should be replaced with, h1 and h2 for better structure and screen reading. The css should reflect these changes to target these changes as well. 
3. The images need to have "alt" attributes for screen readers. 
4. The audio should include captions to make the audio more accessible using the tag p. There could also be a fall back link to download teh audio file if the user's device can't open the audio file. 
5. There should be a hidden visual label for screen readers using "sr-only" class. 
6. To make the hidden comment keyboard accessible it needs to be a button not div.
7. The table should have <th scope ="col"> for column headers and a caption for the content. 
8. To make the overall website more accessible, could make a keyboard focus state that ensures all interactive elements have visible focus states. For better keyboard navigation, there could be a skip to content link at the top of the nav bar so users can skip repetitive content.
